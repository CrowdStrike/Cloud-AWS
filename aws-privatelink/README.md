# PrivateLink Demo
## Overview
The template included here demonstrates the use of AWS PrivateLink to provide provide private connectivity to the 
CrowdStrike sensor proxy and download API.

The template creates a CrowdStrike Shared Services VPC and a test VPC containing a test linux instance.
The VPCs are connected over an AWS transit gateway and a private hosted domain is created that references the VPC 
endpoints and shared with the test VPC.
