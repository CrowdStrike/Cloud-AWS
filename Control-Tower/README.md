# CrowdStrike with AWS Control Tower

CrowdStrike now supports AWS Organization registration directly from the CrowdStrike console. This is the recommended and officially supported approach for customers looking to onboard their AWS accounts across their AWS Organization(s) into the platform.

> Note:  We strongly recommend that you review the requirements section before proceeding so that you understand the resources that the registration process will create for you. For details, please refer to this [document](horizon-organization-onboarding.md)

## Instructions

The AWS Control Tower integration is being updated to reflect the recent updates to Falcon CSPM's account registration process. The project will be released shortly, with major improvements to functionality and user experience to come.
