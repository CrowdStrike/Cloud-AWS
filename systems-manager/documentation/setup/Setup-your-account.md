Setup Systems Manager
=====================

# Prerequisites

Complete the section [Create your AWS SSM package]()

Introduction
------------

CrowdStrike provide a CloudFormation template to assist with the setup of an account so that systems manager can be used
to push the Falcon agent to ec2 instances. The CloudFormation template performs three operations

1. Creates an IAM Role CrowdStrike-SSMExecutionRole.  
   The role has the Amazon managed policy AmazonSSMAutomationRole attached to it

2.  Adds parameters to the Systems Manager Parameter Store

3.  Checks for the existence of a valid installation token in the falcon
    console. If a valid installation token does not exist the template will create a valid token for use by the ssm installation agent.
   
4.  Creates a Systems Manager "automation" document and a systems manager installation "package". 

Deploy the cloudformation template
==================================

1. Download the CloudFormation template from github

    Go to

   [https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Cloud-AWS/tree/master/systems-manager/cloudformation](https://github.com/crowdstrike/cloud-aws/systems-manager/cloudformation)

   Download the template *CrowdStrike-ssm-setup.yaml* from the cloudformation folder

   *Download the files from the S3 folder and the Packaging Utilities folder

   Review the installation scripts in the Falcon folder under S3. If you are happy with the scripts then proceed to Step
   2. If you wish to modify the scripts   
   then follow the
   guide ["creating new install scripts and manifest file"](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Cloud-AWS/tree/master/systems-manager/Packaging%20utilities)
   .

2. Upload all the files in the cloudformation-s3-bucket folder to the S3 bucket that you used in the prerequisites
   section for creating the package. Ensure that the folder structure is maintained.

3. Create the OAuth2 API keys in the CrowdStrike Console The API key will require

        -   "Installation Tokens" -- "Read" + "Write"
        -   "Sensor Download" -- "Read"

   <https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/93/oauth2-auth-token-apis#get-an-auth-token>

    Create an OAuth2 api key pair with permissions to "Read" and "Write"
    Installation Tokens and "Read" for Sensor Download.
