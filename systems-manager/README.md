# Description
Templates for setting up and using AWS Systems Manager to install and uninstall the CrowdStrike Falcon agent in AWS.

# Important Information: 
* The solution requires version *2.3.1550.0* or later of the AWS Sytems Manager agent installed on the host.

* The DEFAULT of the package selected for install will be (latest-release)-2. For example if the latest release of the
  linux sensor is 5.34.9918 the DEFAULT version installed would be 5.33.9808.  
  It is expected that once installed, sensor versions will be managed via the falcon console.
