* `Package-sensor-download.zip` contains the files required to create a package where the sensor is downloaded from the
  CrowdStrike sensor download API.  

* `Package-with-binary.zip` contains the files required to create a package where the sensor is bundled with the
  installer scripts and pushed to the host using the systems manager agent. A copy of the instructions with examples is here [README.md](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Cloud-AWS/tree/systems-manager/systems-manager/Packaging-utilities/examples/linux-sensor-binary)
